# frailty_acs

The goal of frailty_acs is to analyze the intra-individual bleeding risk before, during and after DAPT treatment due to an ACS. It also includes basic a github-setups that were created at the start of the project. It will be updated continuously during the research period. When finalized a link to the final manuscript will be added alongside the SAP. The study will use data from the SWEDEHEART registry, the national patient registry as well as the national drug dispensory registry.
